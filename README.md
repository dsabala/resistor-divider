# Resistor divider
Program for searching pairs of resistors with given ratio, optionally accepts a BOM file with a list of resistors you have and searches for pairs from available nominal values. The program was created as part of a recruitment task that inspired me to leave the comfortable couch of an embedded developer and learn something new.
